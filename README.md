# Multivariate-Analysis-of-Vehicle-Pricing

In collaboration with my teammates, this project applies a range of multivariate statistical methods—including MANOVA, regression analysis, PCA, factor analysis, discriminant analysis, and clustering—to automobile data in order to identify key determinants of price and horsepower, evaluate group differences, and classify vehicles into risk categories with high accuracy.
